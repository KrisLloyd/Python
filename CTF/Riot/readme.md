# My First Riot

### Challenge:
##### <ciphertext>
##### 50 Points


### Solve:

This challenge was a simple ROT47 to plaintext conversion. Using CyberChef, I was able to input the ciphertext and output the flag. Sadly, I was unable to return to the CTF to obtain the original cyphertext for this writeup.

### Flag
```
flag{}
```
